# powerset-kata : Print All the Subsets of a Given Set
This kata has for objective to implement the PowerSet function. In mathematics, PowerSet of any given set S, PS(S) is set of all subsets of S including empty set.
Example:
```
S = {1, 2, 3}
PS(S) = {{ᵩ}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.
```
NB: {ᵩ} is the empty set.

## Objective
Given a set of numbers, print all the possible subsets of it including empty set.
